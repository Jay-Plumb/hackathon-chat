#RecapBot

##Problem
Have you ever been in a group chat and want to be able to filter through the relevant information? Our recapbot uses a machine learning algorithm (bayes filter) to classify relevant from non relevant sentences.

##Tech Stack
* Spark Streaming
* Python for the backend
* Naive bayes filter

##Setup
A bot was created in spark and an ngrok tunnel was used to the webhook. A learning algorithm classifies the sentences and the size of the text it altered (the larger the font, the more relevant the information).

To run the setup, please do the following:

1. In terminal, call `ngrok http <portNumber>`
2. Generate webhook using [Spark for Developers website](https://developer.ciscospark.com/endpoint-webhooks-post.html)
  * In 'Request Headers', change Authorization to Bearer Token of the bot
  * Enter applicable 'Request Parameters' and Run
      [For the 'targetURL' field, enter the `Forwarding` URL generated by ngrok]
3. In another terminal, run **_recapbot.py_**
  * `python recapbot.py`
4. In Spark room, add *recapbot* through "Add people" (e-mail: recapbot@gmail.com)
  * Call *recapbot* using `@recapbot`

##Future Implementations
In the future, the following functionalities will be added to the bot:
  * Get the summary of messages within a specific time period
  * Using `@recapbot /start` to summarise all messages in the current room
  * Adding extra parameters to limit the number of messages outputted by bot after summarisation
