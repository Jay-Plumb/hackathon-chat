### RecapBot

## Problem
Have you ever been in a group chat and want to be able to filter through the relevant information? Our recapbot uses a machine learning algorithm (bayes filter) to classify relevant from non relevant sentences. 

## Tech Stack
* Spark Streaming
* Python for the backend 
*Naive bayes filter

## Setup 
A bot was created in spark and an ngrok tunnel was used to the webhook. A learning algorithm classifies the sentences and the size of the text it altered (the larger the font, the more relevant the information).
